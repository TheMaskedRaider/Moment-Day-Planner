This Day planner put together with javascript using moment and bootstrap will allow users to plan out their day as well as keep track of it.

Using moment js, a table is displayed made with bootstrap for times beginning with 9am to 9pm
in each of these times the user may select a time and type into its field and, should they wish to, save the content so thaqt it may be revisited on page load.
Moment is also used to detirmine the current time
